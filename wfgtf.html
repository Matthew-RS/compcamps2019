<p class="paragragh">Here is "When Fans go to Far," the site of people who went to far becauser they were a fan of a franchise or team.</p>
<p class="paragragh">First we have a cereal lover who was a fan of fruit loops. One problem was he had no milk, since you never can eat cereal when it's dry, he decided he had one option. Coca-Cola. </p>
<p class="paragragh">Second is a Shrek fan, and for Youtube's sake he decided to make a series making him take a bite of an onion everyday, as of July 18th he has posted one hundred seventy-five, minute long videos taking a bite of a raw onion, here's episode 175 if you want ot watch it.</p>
<li class="navlink"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2fMGvtIq6o">Episode 175, Eating an Onion Everyday Until a New Shrek Movie Comes Out</a>
<p class="paragragh">Third, the Turkish province of Batman, this is its actual name, I'm not joking, is holding a petition to reshape its borders to the shape of a batsignal, they also tried sueing Warner Bros for the "Dark Knight" trilogy before.</P>
<p class="paragragh">Fourth, after Philadelphia won one of many of its games, crowds rioted in the streets and it became a giant WTF moment when someone started to climb s stoplight, shirtless.</p>
<p class="paragragh">Last, a madlad from Reddit posts a picture of him turning the upcoming "Sonic the Hedghog" movie trailer coming February 14th, 2020 on a Chromebook in Walmart.</p>
